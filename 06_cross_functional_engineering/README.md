# Cross-Functional Systems Engineering & Delivery

## Context

Most of my work sits at the boundary between hardware design, firmware development, and system validation.
Effective delivery in this space depends as much on **communication and alignment** as on technical execution.

This section outlines my role in supporting cross-functional engineering efforts during development and validation phases.

---

## Scope of Involvement

- Working with hardware designers during bring-up and debug
- Coordinating with firmware engineers to isolate interface-level issues
- Providing validation feedback that informs design and product decisions
- Helping teams converge on practical, testable solutions

---

## Working Style

- Clarify assumptions early to avoid downstream surprises
- Use measurements and data to ground technical discussions
- Frame issues in terms of system impact, not component blame
- Keep validation outcomes actionable for non-test stakeholders

---

## Impact

- Reduced iteration cycles between design and validation
- Improved shared understanding of system limitations and trade-offs
- Smoother handoff between development stages

---

## Notes

This section provides context on collaboration and delivery practices.
Detailed technical examples are covered within the individual project write-ups in this portfolio.
