# Electronics & PCB Validation for Embedded Systems

## Context

Worked on validation and bring-up of embedded electronic systems at the PCB and board level, ensuring that hardware platforms were electrically sound and ready for firmware and system integration.

The work focused on early detection of hardware issues, repeatable bring-up procedures, and clear separation of hardware vs firmware faults.

---

## System Under Test

- Custom PCBs and embedded hardware platforms
- Power regulation and distribution circuitry
- Digital and mixed-signal interfaces
- Board-level interconnects and peripherals

---

## My Role

- Hardware validation and test engineer
- Led PCB bring-up and initial power-on testing
- Defined validation steps and checklists for new board revisions
- Worked closely with firmware and design engineers during debug

---

## Validation & Bring-Up Approach

- Power integrity checks (voltage rails, current consumption, sequencing)
- Verification of clocks, resets, and reference signals
- Signal integrity checks on critical interfaces
- Incremental bring-up to isolate faults early
- Comparison of observed behaviour against schematic intent

The emphasis was on **methodical isolation**, not trial-and-error.

## Tools & Technologies

- Digital multimeters and oscilloscopes
- Logic analyzers for digital interface inspection
- Schematic review and test-point definition
- Python-based logging and data capture where applicable

---

## Key Challenges

- Diagnosing issues caused by layout, component selection, or assembly
- Distinguishing hardware faults from firmware-induced symptoms
- Ensuring test repeatability across board revisions
- Avoiding cascading failures during early power-on

---

## Outcomes & Impact

- Reduced iteration time between PCB revisions
- Enabled stable firmware development on validated hardware
- Improved collaboration between hardware and firmware teams
- Increased confidence in system reliability before integration testing
