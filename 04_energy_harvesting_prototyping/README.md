# Energy Harvesting & Sensor Systems Prototyping

## Context

Worked on experimental prototyping and evaluation of energy harvesting systems focused on extracting usable electrical energy from ambient mechanical sources such as vibration and acoustic excitation.

The work emphasized **measurement-first validation**, realistic power expectations, and system-level trade-offs rather than peak or theoretical output.

## System Under Test

- Vibration- and sound-driven energy harvesting concepts
- Mechanical-to-electrical transduction elements (piezoelectric, electromagnetic)
- Energy storage and buffering elements (capacitors, regulators)
- Sensor and data-logging subsystems for characterization

---

## My Role

- Designed experimental setups to characterize available mechanical energy
- Defined test methodologies to measure input excitation and electrical output
- Evaluated system behavior under varying frequencies, amplitudes, and loads
- Iterated prototypes based on measured performance rather than assumptions

---

## Test & Evaluation Approach

- Measurement of vibration and acoustic profiles (time and frequency domain)
- Correlation of mechanical input to electrical output
- Evaluation of average power vs peak output
- Load testing with realistic duty cycles
- Stability and repeatability checks across operating conditions

The focus was on **average usable power**, not momentary peaks.

## Tools & Technologies

- Sensors and data loggers for vibration and acoustic measurement
- Oscilloscopes and multimeters for electrical characterization
- Python for data analysis and visualization
- Custom test fixtures and mounting strategies

---

## Key Challenges

- Extremely low energy density in ambient vibration and sound
- Sensitivity to mounting, orientation, and frequency alignment
- Large gap between theoretical maxima and practical output
- Avoiding misleading results caused by short-lived peaks

---

## Outcomes & Impact

- Developed a realistic understanding of where energy harvesting is viable
- Identified clear boundaries between sensing-grade power and extractable power
- Informed system architecture decisions and pilot feasibility
- Reinforced the importance of separating **energy assessment** from **energy extraction**

---

## Engineering Perspective

Energy harvesting succeeds only when:
- expectations are aligned with physics
- measurement precedes design decisions
- scalability is considered from the first prototype

This work prioritised clarity, repeatability, and honest system limits over headline numbers.
