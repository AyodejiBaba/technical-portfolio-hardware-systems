## Hardware, Systems & Test Engineering Portfolio

This repository presents representative projects from my work in hardware validation, embedded systems, firmware testing, and applied R&D.

Due to NDAs and company ownership, some projects are described at the system and test-strategy level rather than with full schematics or source code.

## Core Expertise

- Post-silicon validation and characterization
- Electronics & PCB bring-up and fault isolation
- Firmware and low-level interface testing
- Test process design and automation (Python)
- Experimental prototyping and data-driven iteration
- Cross-functional systems engineering
