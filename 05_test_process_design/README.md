# Test Process Design & Validation Strategy

## Context

Across multiple projects, I have been responsible not only for executing tests, but for defining **how systems should be tested** in a structured, repeatable, and scalable way.

This includes designing validation strategies that align technical constraints, product requirements, and practical execution realities.

---

## Scope of Work

- Translating product and system requirements into test objectives
- Defining test coverage and pass/fail criteria
- Designing test sequences that balance depth with execution time
- Establishing repeatable procedures for bring-up, validation, and regression testing

---

## Approach

- Start with clear success criteria tied to system behavior
- Separate exploratory testing from validation testing
- Prioritise repeatability over one-off measurements
- Design tests that can evolve alongside hardware and firmware revisions

The emphasis is on **clarity and consistency**, not exhaustive testing for its own sake.

---

## Tools & Artefacts

- Written test plans and validation checklists
- Python-based scripts for basic automation and logging
- Structured result summaries for design and product teams

## Notes

This section serves as an overview of my approach to test process design.
Specific examples are illustrated within the individual project case studies elsewhere in this portfolio.
