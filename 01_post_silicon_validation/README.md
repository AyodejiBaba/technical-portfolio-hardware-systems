# Post-Silicon Validation of MEMS Timing Devices

## Context

Worked on post-silicon validation and characterization of MEMS-based timing and clocking devices intended for use in real hardware systems.

The focus was on verifying that manufactured silicon behaved as expected across operating conditions, and identifying deviations early enough to inform design, product, and system decisions.

## System Under Test

- MEMS timing / clock devices
- Evaluation boards and laboratory test setups
- External measurement instrumentation

---

## My Role

- Post-silicon validation engineer
- Responsible for silicon bring-up and functional verification
- Designed and executed validation tests across voltage, temperature, and frequency corners
- Analysed measured behaviour against datasheet expectations

---

## Validation Approach

- Functional validation against documented requirements
- Parametric characterization across operating ranges
- Corner-case testing to expose non-ideal or unstable behaviour
- Correlation of results across multiple samples and conditions

The goal was not just pass/fail, but understanding **why** behaviour changed.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python for test automation, data processing, and analysis
- Oscilloscopes, signal generators, power supplies
- Environmental variation (voltage and temperature)
- Structured logging and result reporting

---

## Key Challenges

- Variability between expected and observed silicon behaviour
- Sensitivity to environmental and operating conditions
- Distinguishing measurement artefacts from real device limitations
- Balancing test coverage with practical execution time

---

## Outcomes & Impact

- Identified performance limits and edge-case behaviours early
- Increased confidence in device robustness before downstream integration
- Provided actionable feedback to design and product teams
- Reduced risk during system-level deployment
